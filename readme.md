# Scentronix web interviews

Hello guys,

I applied for the fullstack position. This is my results of the assignment.

## 1. Website

Folder: `./web`

Regarding the web, I tried to make it as close as possible to the design. 
To be honest, I haven't spent time on NextJs as well as Mui UI, hence I don't have much experience on this. 

So to save time and focus on the main part of the assignment I decided not to use Mui UI when implementing the design. Instead, I use pure CSS, with the support of CSS-in-JS framework, styled-components. I add some small enhancements so the page can work well on mobile web.

I do believe that, with the basic knowledge of CSS I can work well with any CSS approaches as well as UI library like Mui UI.

## 2. NodeJS Back-end

Folder: `./nodejs-interviews`

Please run these commands to get it running 

```shell
cd ./nodejs-interviews
yarn run test
```

I have spent some time getting familiar with NodeJS env. Since I didn't spend time on it for a while. Hopefully, the tests explain themself.

If you have further requests, please let me know. I would love to spend more time on it.

Thank you so much for your time,
